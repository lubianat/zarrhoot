      - "To flatten the multiscales array structure"
      - "To zip OME-Zarr files for easier sharing"

      - "name"
      - "version"
    time_limit: 20
    correct_answer: "3"

  - question: "In a coordinate system's 'axes' list, what does 'discrete': true indicate?"
    answers:
      - "The axis allows for interpolation between values"
      - "The axis may be indexed only by integers"
      - "The axis represents a continuous physical dimension"
      - "The axis is hidden from the user"
    time_limit: 20
    correct_answer: "2"

  - question: "Which of the following is NOT a valid axis type in RFC-5?"
    answers:
      - "space"
      - "color"
      - "time"
      - "channel"
    time_limit: 20
    correct_answer: "2"

  - question: "Where should transformations between two or more images be stored?"
    answers:
      - "Inside the image array itself"
      - "In a separate external XML file"
      - "In the root 'zarr.json' only"
      - "In the attributes of a parent zarr group"
    time_limit: 20
    correct_answer: "4"

  - question: "What is the 'identity' transformation?"
    answers:
      - "Maps input coordinates to output coordinates without modification"
      - "Inverts the axes"
      - "Scales the image by 1000%"
      - "Removes all metadata"
    time_limit: 20
    correct_answer: "1"

  - question: "How is an 'affine' transformation matrix stored?"
    answers:
      - "As a comma-separated string"
      - "As a 2D array (JSON or Zarr array)"
      - "As a binary blob"
      - "It cannot be stored"
    time_limit: 20
    correct_answer: "2"

  - question: "What does the 'sequence' transformation do?"
    answers:
      - "Reverses the order of axes"
      - "Generates a sequence of numbers"
      - "Applies a list of transformations in order"
      - "Converts the image to a video sequence"
    time_limit: 20
    correct_answer: "3"

  - question: "What is the purpose of the 'inverseOf' transformation?"
    answers:
      - "To delete a transformation"
      - "To indicate a transformation is the inverse of another"
      - "To create a mirror image of the data"
      - "To undo the last edit to the file"
    time_limit: 20
    correct_answer: "2"

  - question: "Which axis type is usually considered 'continuous' (discrete: false)?"
    answers:
      - "channel"
      - "coordinate"
      - "space"
      - "displacement"
    time_limit: 20
    correct_answer: "3"
